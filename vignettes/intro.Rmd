## Overview

__StatComp21065__ is a simple R package developed to homework (implemented the code in homework.Rmd) for the 'Statistical Computing' course. There are two functions that are relevant to my research, namely, _gendata_ (generate two class data for classification) and _bess_svm_ (best subset selection on svm).
